= Configuration Profiles

Quarkus supports the notion of configuration profiles.
These allow you to have multiple configurations in the same file and select between them via a profile name.

Quarkus has three profiles by default, although it is possible to use as many as you like. The default profiles are:

* `dev` - Activated when in development mode (i.e. `quarkus:dev`)
* `test` - Activated when running tests
* `prod` - The default profile when not running in development or test mode

Let's change the `VillainApplicationLifeCycle` so it displays the current profile.

For that, just add a log invoking `ProfileManager.getActiveProfile()` in the `onStart()` method:

[source,indent=0]
----
LOGGER.info("The application VILLAIN is starting with profile " + ProfileManager.getActiveProfile());
----

[NOTE]
--
If not already done, you need to add the following import statement: `import io.quarkus.runtime.configuration.ProfileManager;`
--

In the `application.properties` file, you can prefix a property with the profile.
For example, we did add the `%test.level.multiplier=1` property in the previous chapter.
It indicates that the property `level.multiplier` is set to 1 in the `test` profile.

Now, you will get the `dev` profile enabled if you start your application in dev mode with `mvn compile quarkus:dev`.
If you start the tests, the `test` profile is enabled (the `multiplier` is set to 1).

You can also create your own profiles, and activate them with the `quarkus.profile` property.
For example, to use a profile called `foo`, package your application with `mvn package`, and start it with `java -Dquarkus.profile=foo -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.
You will see that the `foo` profile is enabled.
As not overridden, the `level.multiplier` property has the value 0.5.

Profiles are handy to customize the configuration per environment.
We are going to see an example of such customization in the next section.
