[[quarkus-lifecycle]]
= Application Lifecycle

Now that you know how Quarkus is structured let's continue using various extensions.
You often need to execute custom actions when the application starts and clean up everything when the application stops.
In this module, we will display a banner in the logs once the Villain microservice has started.

== Directory Structure

In this section, we will add an extra class (`VillainApplicationLifeCycle`) to handle the Villain API lifecycle.
You will end up with the following directory structure:

[plantuml]
----
@startsalt
{
{
T
super-heroes
+  rest-villains
++  src
+++  main
++++  java
+++++  io
++++++  quarkus
+++++++  workshop
++++++++  superheroes
+++++++++  villain
++++++++++  Villain.java
++++++++++  VillainApplication.java
++++++++++  VillainApplicationLifeCycle.java <-- added
++++++++++  VillainResource.java
++++++++++  VillainService.java
++  pom.xml
}
}

== Displaying a Banner

When our application starts, the logs are dull and lack a banner (any decent application *must* have a banner nowadays).

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

So the first thing that you need to do is to go to the http://patorjk.com/software/taag[following website] and pick up your favorite "Villain API" text banner.

Create a new class named `VillainApplicationLifeCycle` (or pick another name, the name does not matter) in the `io.quarkus.workshop.superheroes.villain` package, and copy your banner, so you end up with something like the following:

[source]
----
package io.quarkus.workshop.superheroes.villain;

import io.quarkus.runtime.ShutdownEvent;
import io.quarkus.runtime.StartupEvent;
import org.jboss.logging.Logger;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;

@ApplicationScoped
public class VillainApplicationLifeCycle {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(VillainApplicationLifeCycle.class);

    void onStart(@Observes StartupEvent ev) {
        LOGGER.info(" __     ___ _ _       _             _    ____ ___ ");
        LOGGER.info(" \\ \\   / (_) | | __ _(_)_ __       / \\  |  _ \\_ _|");
        LOGGER.info("  \\ \\ / /| | | |/ _` | | '_ \\     / _ \\ | |_) | | ");
        LOGGER.info("   \\ V / | | | | (_| | | | | |   / ___ \\|  __/| | ");
        LOGGER.info("    \\_/  |_|_|_|\\__,_|_|_| |_|  /_/   \\_\\_|  |___|");
    }

    void onStop(@Observes ShutdownEvent ev) {
        LOGGER.info("The application VILLAIN is stopping...");
    }
}
----

Thanks to the CDI `@Observes`, the `VillainApplicationLifeCycle` is invoked.
On startup with the `StartupEvent` so it can execute code (here, displaying the banner) when the application is starting

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Run the application with: `./mvnw quarkus:dev`, the banner is printed to the console.
When the application is stopped, the second log message is printed.

[NOTE]
====
If your application is still running, just send an HTTP request, like go to http://localhost:8084.
====

The method is called by ArC, the dependency injection framework used by Quarkus.
Arc embraces the build-time principle, meaning that injection happens at build time.
In addition, Arc can detect and remove unused beans at runtime, saving memory.

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

With the application running in dev mode, open your browser to http://localhost:8084/q/dev/.
In the ArC widget, you can see the number of beans that have been removed ("Removed Beans"), and if you click on the link, see the list.
If you click on the "Observers" link, you will see the two methods we added.
In the "Fired Events" view, you can see which event has been fired and when.
