= Welcome

Let's say you are not a (Java) developer, and you are interested in deploying your applications to the cloud.
You know some Docker, you don't know anything about Kubernetes (and don't want to learn), but you have heard of https://azure.microsoft.com[Microsoft Azure].
This workshop is for you.

This workshop offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session with https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-apps[Azure Container Apps], from pushing containerized microservices, to deploying an entire infrastructure, to execute microservices and consuming them.
But, what are we going to deploy to Azure Container Apps?
Well, it's going to be a set of microservices:

* Developed with https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] (the microservices are already developed, and you don't need to know Quarkus)
* Exposing HTTP APIs
* Exchanging events with Apache Kafka
* Storing data in databases
* With some parts of the dark side of microservices (resilience, health, monitoring)
* Answer the ultimate question: are super-heroes stronger than super-villains?

This workshop is a BYOL (_Bring Your Own Laptop_) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop, and be ready to install a few set of tools.
What you are going to learn:

* What is Azure Container Apps and what is Quarkus
* How to build Docker images out of an existing Java application
* How to execute the Docker images locally with Docker Compose
* How to push the Docker images to Azure Registry
* How to create managed services in Azure (Postgres database, Kafka)
* How to deploy microservices to Azure Container Apps
* How to configure Docker images in Azure Container Apps
* How you improve the resilience of our microservices
* And much more!

Ready? Here we go!
