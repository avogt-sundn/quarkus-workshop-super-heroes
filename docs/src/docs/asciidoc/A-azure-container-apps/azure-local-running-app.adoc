= Running the Application Locally

'''

In this chapter we will build containers out of our Quarkus microservices and execute them locally thanks to Docker Compose.
Then, we will push the containers to Azure Container Registry so we can still run them locally, and later on Azure Container Apps.

[NOTE]
====
Building containers locally and pushing them to Azure Container Registry can take from 15 to 30 minutes (depending on your CPU and bandwith).
If you think you will not have enough time to complete the Workshop, you can skip the next optional sections and go straight to _Running remote containers_.
====

== (Optional) Building containers

In this section, we are going to package our microservices into containers.
In particular, we are going to produce Linux 64 bits native executables and runs them in a container.
The native compilation uses the OS and architecture of the host system.

And... Linux Containers are ... _Linux_.
So to build a container with a Linux native executable (even if you are on Windows or Mac), Quarkus comes with a trick to produce these executable.
First, Quarkus comes with a set of `Dockerfiles`.
The `Dockerfile.native` file is for running the application in native mode.
It looks like this:

[source,text]
----
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal:8.5
WORKDIR /work/
RUN chown 1001 /work \
    && chmod "g+rwX" /work \
    && chown 1001:root /work
COPY --chown=1001:root target/*-runner /work/application

EXPOSE 8080
USER 1001

CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
----

It's a pretty straightforward `Dockerfile` taking a minimal base image and copying the generated native executable.

[TIP]
====
Building a native executable takes time, CPU, and memory.
It's even more accurate in the container.
So, first, be sure that your container system has enough memory to build the executable.
It requires at least 6Gb of memory, 8Gb is recommended.

Execute the following commands to build all our microservices and the UI.
This will build Docker images out of Linux native executables:
Under the `quarkus-workshop-super-heroes/super-heroes` directory execute the following Docker commands:

[source,shell]
----
cd rest-heroes
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.build-native -t quarkus/rest-heroes .
cd ..

cd rest-villains
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.build-native -t quarkus/rest-villains ../..
cd ..

cd rest-fights
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.build-native -t quarkus/rest-fights .
cd ..

cd event-statistics
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.build-native -t quarkus/event-statistics .
cd ..

cd ui-super-heroes
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.build-native -t quarkus/ui-super-heroes .
cd ..
----

Check that you have all the Docker images installed locally:

[source,shell]
----
docker image ls | grep quarkus
----

The output should look like this:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus/ui-super-heroes         latest      266MB
quarkus/event-statistics        latest      145MB
quarkus/rest-fights             latest      198MB
quarkus/rest-villains           latest      158MB
quarkus/rest-heroes             latest      154MB
----

== (Optional) Running local containers

Now that we have all our Docker containers created, let's execute them all to be sure that everything is working.

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Under `super-heroes/infrastructure` you will find the `docker-compose-app-local.yaml` file.
It declares all the needed infrastructure (databases, Kafka) as well as our microservices.
Execute it with:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-local.yaml up
----

To know that all your containers are started, you can use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-local.yaml ps
----

You should get something similar to the following list.
Make sure all your containers are in _running_ status:

[source,shell]
----
event-statistics    "./application -Dqua…"   running
kafka               "sh -c 'export CLUST…"   running
rest-fights         "./application -Dqua…"   running
rest-heroes         "./application -Dqua…"   running
rest-villains       "./application -Dqua…"   running
super-database      "docker-entrypoint.s…"   running (healthy)
ui-super-heroes     "/bin/sh -c 'npm sta…"   running
----

Once all the containers are started, you can:

* Go to http://localhost:8080 to check the main UI
* Go to http://localhost:8085 to check the statistics UI
* curl http://localhost:8084/api/villains | jq
* curl http://localhost:8083/api/heroes | jq
* curl http://localhost:8082/api/fights/randomfighters | jq

Then, make sure you shut down the entire application with:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-local.yaml down
----

== (Optional) Pushing containers to Azure Container Registry

Now that we have all our Docker containers running locally, let's push them to Azure Container Registry.

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you've set all the environment variables defined in the previous chapter and that you've also created the resource group and the Azure Container Registry.
====

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Before you can push an image to your registry, you must tag it with the fully qualified name of your registry login server (the `REGISTRY_URL` variable).
Tag the image using the `docker tag` commands:

[source,shell]
----
docker tag quarkus/ui-super-heroes:latest   $UI_IMAGE
docker tag quarkus/event-statistics:latest  $STATISTICS_IMAGE
docker tag quarkus/rest-fights:latest       $FIGHTS_IMAGE
docker tag quarkus/rest-villains:latest     $VILLAINS_IMAGE
docker tag quarkus/rest-heroes:latest       $HEROES_IMAGE
----

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

To be able to push these Docker images to Azure Registry, we first need to log in to the registry:

[source,shell]
----
az acr login \
  --name "$REGISTRY"
----

You should see the prompt _Login Succeeded_.

Then, push all the images with the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
docker push $UI_IMAGE
docker push $STATISTICS_IMAGE
docker push $FIGHTS_IMAGE
docker push $VILLAINS_IMAGE
docker push $HEROES_IMAGE
----

You can check that the images have been pushed to Azure Container Registry by executing the following command:

[source,shell]
----
az acr repository list \
  --name "$REGISTRY" \
  --output table
----

You can also get some information on a particular repository or image if needed:

[source,shell]
----
az acr repository show \
  --name "$REGISTRY" \
  --repository "$HEROES_APP"
----

You can visualize the content of the registry on the https://portal.azure.com[Azure Portal].

== Running remote containers

[NOTE]
====
icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

If you haven't skipped the previous optional sections and built the containers your self, you should edit the `docker-compose-app-remote.yaml` file under `super-heroes/infrastructure` and change the name `superheroesregistry` with the value of the `$REGISTRY` variable.
====

icon:hand-point-right[role="red", size=2x] [red big]#Call to action#

Now that we have all our Docker containers pushed to Azure Container Registry, let's execute them with:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-remote.yaml up
----

Once all the containers are started, you can:

* Go to http://localhost:8080 to check the main UI
* Go to http://localhost:8085 to check the statistics UI
* curl http://localhost:8084/api/villains | jq
* curl http://localhost:8083/api/heroes | jq
* curl http://localhost:8082/api/fights/randomfighters | jq

On http://localhost:8080 you should see the user interface, and you should be able to fight super heroes against super villains:

image::angular-ui.png[]

On http://localhost:8085 you should see the statistics of the fights.
When super heroes and super heroes are fights, the statistics shows which one has won the most fights, and the percentage of fights won by the two groups.
The UI is automatically updated at each fight:

image::angular-ui-stats.png[]

You should see the user interface and everything should work.
Remember to shutdown the entire application with:

[source,shell]
----
docker compose -f docker-compose-app-remote.yaml down
----

Ok, enough running these containers locally!
In the next chapter we will take these remote containers, configure them, and make them work remotely on Azure Container Apps.
