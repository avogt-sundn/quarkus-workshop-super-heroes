= Presenting the Workshop

This workshop should give you a practical introduction to Azure Container Apps.
You will practice all the needed tools to deploy an entire microservice architecture, mixing classical HTTP, reactive and event-based microservices.
You will finish by monitoring and scaling the microservices so they can handle the load.

The idea is that you leave this workshop with a good understanding of what Azure Container Apps is, what it is not, and how it can help you in your projects.
Then, you'll be prepared to investigate a bit more on your own.

== What Will You Be Deploying?

In this workshop, you will deploy an existing application that allows superheroes to fight against supervillains.
You will be containerizing and deploying several microservices communicating either synchronously via REST or asynchronously using Kafka:

* _Super Hero UI_: an Angular application to pick up a random superhero, a random supervillain, and makes them fight.
The Super Hero UI is exposed via Quarkus and invokes the Fight REST API.
* _Villain REST API_: A classical HTTP microservice exposing CRUD operations on Villains, stored in a PostgreSQL database.
* _Hero REST API_: A reactive HTTP microservice exposing CRUD operations on Heroes, stored in a Postgres database.
* _Fight REST API_: This REST API invokes the Hero and Villain APIs to get a random superhero and supervillain.
Each fight is, then, stored in a PostgreSQL database.
This microservice can be developed using both the classical (_imperative_) or reactive approach.
Invocations to the hero and villain services are protected using resilience patterns (retry, timeout, circuit-breakers).
* _Statistics_: Each fight is asynchronously sent (via Kafka) to the Statistics microservice.
It has an HTML + JQuery UI displaying all the statistics.

The main UI allows you to pick up one random Hero and Villain by clicking on "New Fighters."
Then it's just a matter of clicking on "Fight!" to get them to fight.
The table at the bottom shows the list of the previous fights.

== How Does This Workshop Work?

You have this material in your hands (either electronically or printed), and you can now follow it step by step.
The structure of this workshop is as follow :

* _Installing all the needed tools_:
in this section, you will install all the tools and code to be able to bundle, package and deploy our application
* _Azure Container Apps and Quarkus_:
this section introduces Quarkus and Azure Container Apps to make sure you have all the needed vocabulary to follow along
* _Running the Application Locally_:
in this section, you will build Docker images out of Quarkus microservices, execute them locally with Docker compose, push them to Azure Registry, all that using Docker and Azure CLI
* _Running the Application on Azure Container Apps_:
in this section, you will create an entire infrastructure on Azure (Postgres databases, Kafka, etc.) and deploy the microservices to Azure Container Apps
* _Administrating_:
in this section, you will add some load to your microservices, monitor them, scale them, check the logs, etc.

If you already have the tools installed, skip the _Installing all the needed tools_ section and jump to the sections _Azure Container Apps and Quarkus_ or straight to _Running the Application Locally_ (if you already know Quarkus and Azure Container Apps), and start hacking on the command lines.
This "Ã  la carte" mode lets you make the most of this 2 to 4-hour long hands-on lab.

== What Do You Have to Do?

This workshop should be as self-explanatory as possible.
So your job is to follow the instructions by yourself, do what you are supposed to do, and do not hesitate to ask for any clarification or assistance;
that's why the team is here.

Oh, and be ready to have some fun!

== Software Requirements

First of all, make sure you have a 64bits computer with admin rights (so you can install all the needed tools) and at least 16Gb of RAM (as some tools need a few resources).

[WARNING]
====
If you are using Mac OS X, make sure the version is greater than 10.11.x (Captain).
====

This workshop will make use of the following Software, tools, frameworks that you will need to install and now (more or less) how it works:

* Azure CLI
* Docker
* cURL (or any other command line HTTP client)
* (optionally) Any IDE you feel comfortable with (eg. Intellij IDEA, Eclipse IDE, VS Code..)

The following section focuses on how to install and set up the needed Software.
You can skip the next section if you have already installed all the prerequisites.

[WARNING]
====
This workshop assumes a bash shell.
If you run on Windows, in particular, adjust the commands accordingly.
