= Event-driven and Reactive microservices

'''

So far, we have build 3 microservices, all using HTTP to interact.
However, HTTP has significant flaws, such as temporal coupling between the different microservices.
If the service is not there or is slow, the caller is directly impacted.
Also, it's hard to guess the capacity of the service you call; maybe you should not call it right now because this service is under heavy load.

Fortunately, event-driven microservices are rising and avoid most of these issues.
By using events (wrapped in messages), the different microservices enforce a looser coupling.
Depending on the messaging protocol you use, it may handle durability (avoiding the temporal coupling) and back-pressure (avoiding the overload).

In this section, we are going to see how Quarkus let you build event-driven microservices.
More specially, you are going to see how to:

* Send messages and process them
* Connect a Quarkus application to Apache Kafka
* Write Kafka records and read them
* Use reactive programming to compute statistics on the fly
* Send messages to the browser using web sockets

Quarkus uses MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to interact with Apache Kafka, and other messaging middleware (such as AMQP).footnote:[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging]

In this chapter, we are going to use events as a way for microservices to interact.
You are going to extend the current system with the `stats` group depicted on the next figure:

[plantuml,align=center]

include::{plantDir}/6-messaging-physical-architecture.puml[]

When the application persists a new fight, in the _fight_ microservice, you are going to send it to a Kafka topic.
These messages are read in the _statistics_ microservice, processed, and the result is sent to a UI using web sockets.

IMPORTANT: This service is exposed on the port 8085.
