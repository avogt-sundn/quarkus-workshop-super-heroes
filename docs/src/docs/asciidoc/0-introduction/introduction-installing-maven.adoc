= Apache Maven {maven-version}

All the examples of this workshop are built and tested using Maven.footnote:[Maven https://maven.apache.org]
Maven offers a building solution, shared libraries, and a plugin platform for your projects, allowing you to do quality control, documentation, teamwork, and so forth.
Based on the "convention over configuration" principle, Maven brings a standard project description and a number of conventions such as a standard directory structure.
With an extensible architecture based on plugins, Maven can offer many different services.

== Installing Maven

The examples of this workshop have been developed with Apache Maven {maven-version}.
Once you have installed JDK {jdk-version}, make sure the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set.
Then, download Maven from http://maven.apache.org/, unzip the file on your hard drive and add the `apache-maven/bin` directory to your `PATH` variable.
More details about the installation process are available on https://maven.apache.org/install.html.

But of course, if you are on Mac OS X and use Homebrew, install Maven with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
brew install maven
----

== Checking for Maven Installation

Once you've got Maven installed, open a command line and enter `mvn -version` to validate your installation.
Maven should print its version and the JDK version it uses (which is handy as you might have different JDK versions installed on the same machine).

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.8.4 (ea98e05a04480131370aa0c110b8c54cf726c06f)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.4/libexec
Java version: 11.0.15, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /Users/clement/.sdkman/candidates/java/11.0.15.hs-adpt
Default locale: en_FR, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "11.5", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
----

Be aware that Maven needs Internet access to download plugins and project dependencies from the Maven Central and other remote repositories.footnote:[Maven Central https://search.maven.org]

== Some Maven Commands

Maven is a command-line utility where you can use several parameters and options to build, test, or package your code.
To get some help on the commands, you can type, use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn --help

usage: mvn [options] [<goal(s)>] [<phase(s)>]
----

Here are some commands that you will be using to run the examples in the workshop.
Each invokes a different phase of the project life cycle (clean, compile, install, etc.) and use the `pom.xml` to download libraries, customize the compilation, or extend some behaviors with plugins:

* `mvn clean`: Deletes all generated files (compiled classes, generated code, artifacts etc.).
* `mvn compile`: Compiles the main Java classes.
* `mvn test-compile`: Compiles the test classes.
* `mvn test`: Compiles the main Java classes as well as the test classes and executes the tests.
* `mvn package`: Compiles, executes the tests, and packages the code into an archive.
* `mvn install`: Builds and installs the artifacts in your local repository.
* `mvn clean install`: Cleans and installs (note that you can add several commands separated by a space, like `mvn clean compile test`).
