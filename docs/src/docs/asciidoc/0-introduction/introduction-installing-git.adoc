= Git

Git{wj}footnote:[Git https://git-scm.com] is a free and open source distributed version control system designed for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.
Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.

== Installing Git

On Mac, if you have installed Homebrew, then installing Git is just a matter of a single command.

== Checking for Git Installation

Once installed, check for Git by running `git --version` in the terminal.
It should display the git version:
