= Creating a _classical_ REST/HTTP Microservice

'''

At the heart of the Super-Hero application comes Villains!
You can't have superheroes without super-villains.

We need to expose a REST API allowing CRUD operations on villains.
This microservice is, let's say, a _classical_ REST microservice.
It uses HTTP to expose a REST API and internally store data into a database.
It's using the _imperative_ development model.

The _fight_ microservice will use this service.

In the following sections, you learn:

* How to create a new Quarkus application
* How to implement REST API using JAX-RS and the RESTEasy Reactive extensionfootnote:[RESTEasy Reactive support the reactive and imperative development models.]
* How to compose your application using beans
* How to access your database using Hibernate ORM with Panache
* How to use transactions
* How to enable OpenAPI and Swagger-UI

IMPORTANT: This service is exposed on the port 8084.

But first, let's describe our service.
The Super-Villains microservice manages villains with their names, powers, and so on.
The REST API allows adding, removing, listing, and picking a random villain from the stored set.
Nothing outstanding but a good first step to discover Quarkus.
